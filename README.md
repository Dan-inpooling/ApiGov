# Why is this tool useful?


# Why do we create this tool?
In the past couple of years, we saw increasing usage of 3rd party APIs. Also, more and more data are shared via APIs.

In my previous job doing cyber security risk consulting, I saw companies lacking visibility around data shared via APIs. With GDPR and CCPA, it is becoming mandate for companies to have data governance around their APIs.    

My co-founder has extensive experience is DevOps and software development. He wanted to have a tool for client API monitoring, beyond exgress logging. He was constantly fighting with client API outages and could not optimize the API usage based on needs.

We are both excited to build a tool that can log API calls, visualize API data flows, send alerts for outages and suspicious data flows.
